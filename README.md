Total Time: 11 minutes

Process Summary:

Minutes 0-1: Read and understood the requirements, planned approach

Minutes 1-3: Created the program header and function prototypes

Minutes 3-7: Implemented all 9 functions using a consistent pattern

Minutes 7-8: Created comprehensive test cases in main()

Minutes 8-9: Reviewed code for standards compliance and tested mentally

Key Observations:

The functions are repetitive but follow the exact requirement of having separate functions for each case

I used a consistent pattern: initialize with first value, then compare with each subsequent value

Test cases cover: normal cases, equal values, negative numbers, and mixed values

All coding standards were followed (camelCase, indentation, line length, grouping, etc.)

The code demonstrates the progression from simple (largestOfTwo) to complex (largestOfTen)
